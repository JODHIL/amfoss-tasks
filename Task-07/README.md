To start with this task,First i had to clone the reference github folder to my pc 
using the gitclone command and pasting the link of the repository.
After adding all the assets to my laptop i started to find on how to make a weather
 forecast extension and came through this vedio which helped me a lot!
I used the assets given and modified a bit of the code to complete this task.
