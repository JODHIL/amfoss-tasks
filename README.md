Hi my name is Jodhil lal . I am from CSE B
I would love to join this prestigious club and i will ensure and prove to do all my work with atmost sincerity discipline and effort.
As i have heard of the importance and impact of the club i will make sure to get in this wonderful team.

My goals for the next six months it to have a strong foundation and learn as much as i can about open soruce development and devolop my skills as much as i can.

As of now all i could contribute to the team is share whatever new knowledge i get, work as a team and use it for greater good.
I wish to become a huge asset rather than a liability to the club and give back as much as i can.

Regards
Jodhil Lal
